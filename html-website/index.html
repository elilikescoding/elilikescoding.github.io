  <h1>Frogs</h1>
  <p>Frogs are amphibians found all over the world. Most of them are found in tropical regions, but some species can be found in other climates. They have a long history of being associated with good luck and fortune.</p>
  <p>Frogs come in many shapes and sizes. The smallest frogs are the size of a penny, while the largest frogs can grow up to 12 inches long. Most frogs have eyes that are located on the sides of their head, allowing them to see in all directions.</p>
  <p>Frogs have different types of skin. The skin can be smooth, warty, or even slimy. The skin helps the frog to stay moist and to regulate its temperature. Frogs also have long sticky tongues, which they use to catch prey.</p>
