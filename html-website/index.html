  <h1>Frogs</h1>
  <p><h3><tt>Frogs are amphibians in the orders Anura (meaning "without tail" in Greek) and Salientia (or Ranidae). There are over 4,800 recorded species, accounting for over 85% of extant amphibian species. They are found throughout the world, except for Antarctica and some remote islands.</tt></p>
  <p><tt>Most frogs live on the ground, but some species live in trees. They have bulging eyes, a long sticky tongue, webbed feet and no tail. They come in a variety of colors, from bright greens and oranges to dull browns and blacks. Many species have adapted to their environment, changing their coloration to better blend in.</tt></p>
  <p><tt>Frogs are carnivorous, feeding on insects, worms, spiders, and other small animals. They use their strong, sticky tongues to capture their prey. Some species have also adapted to eat fruit, small fish, and even other frogs.</tt></h3></p>
